# To Do

- Force refresh when hash doesn't match (this is needed since you might go to a post that was just added and therefore isn't in your local cached copy).
- Do routing using JS instead of reloading entire page.
- Implement a search engine.
- Put all styles in one file and use fewer media queries inside it (use calc / vw for font size for example).
